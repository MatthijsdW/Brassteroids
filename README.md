A 2D steampunk space game in which the player has to acquire resources from asteroids and enemies to both upgrade their ship and craft equipment for the ship.

Currently this game is just a single placeholder ship with a placeholder axe, which can be used to destroy the tree asteroids. These do not yet drop any wood.
